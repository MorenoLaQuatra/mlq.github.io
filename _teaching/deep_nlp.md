This is a master-level course for student in "Data Science and Engineering" specialization. I'm involved as teaching assistant both for in-class and Lab practices.
An unextensive list of the topic is reported below:

* Text processing
* Word- and Sentence-level embeddings
* Deep learning architectures (Elmo, BERT and beyond)
* Details of NLP tasks (Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Text Summarization, IR, Chatbots)

The final exam will *also* include a final project.
