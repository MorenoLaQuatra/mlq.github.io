This huggingface space contains the demo for CALM, a model that is able to align music and natural language descriptions. It is a limited version of the model, trained on FMA dataset and running over 1K examples only. The project repository is available here: https://github.com/MorenoLaQuatra/CALM . We are currently writing a paper describing the model.
