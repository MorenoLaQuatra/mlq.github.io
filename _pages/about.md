ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Moreno La Quatra, a PhD Candidate at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it) focusing on the analysis of Natural Language and Audio.
I'm mostly interested in machine listening and natural language understanding. Some active research areas:

* Multimodal summarization (e.g., [podcasts](https://github.com/MorenoLaQuatra/MATeR))
* Music Information Retrieval (e.g., [CALM](https://github.com/MorenoLaQuatra/CALM))
* Audio analysis (e.g., both environmental and voice)
* Scientometrics and general scientific document analysis (e.g., [THExt](https://github.com/MorenoLaQuatra/THExt))

That list is by no means exhaustive. I'm interested in many other topics and problems, so feel free to reach out!

I also co-supervise some master thesis at Politecnico di Torino. If you are a student in PoliTO and you are looking for a thesis in this domain, please take a look at our [repository](https://github.com/MorenoLaQuatra/MTI-polito) that contains the updated thesis proposals.
